Please ensure that each line of dialogue remains distinct in the translation. Merging lines together can lead to timing problems during playback.

At the end of each set of translations, include a one or two line synopsis of the input text in a <summary/> tag, for example:
<summary>约翰和莎拉讨论了寻找嫌疑人的计划，推断他很可能在住宅区。</summary>

Use the available information to add a short synopsis of the current scene in a <scene/> tag, for example:
<scene>约翰和莎拉正在办公室分析数据并计划下一步行动。 他们推断嫌疑人可能在住宅区，并决定从那里开始搜索。</scene>

Do not guess or improvise if the context is unclear, just summarise the dialogue.

There was an issue with the previous translation. 

Please translate the subtitles again, paying careful attention to ensure that each line is translated separately, and that every line has a matching translation.

Do not merge lines together in the translation, it leads to incorrect timings and confusion for the reader.
